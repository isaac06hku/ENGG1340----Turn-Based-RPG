You (groaning, awakening):
"Ahhh... my head... Where... where am I?"
"The streets... they're empty. Where is everyone?"
Before you, a sign leans into the wind — not a guide, but a warning.

[Change difficulties]
The old sign writes <Choose Your Trial>:
A Mysterious Voice, deep and unearthly, speaks:
"Before you lie a path of choices.
Choose not with fear... but with the weight of your will."
On the Sign, words appears and glowing faintly:
Wanderer (normal): "Fair fight. Trouble ahead, but you can handle it."
Seeker (hard): "Harder hits, tougher enemies. Stay sharp."
Doom Strider (difficult): "No second chances. No mercy."

You:
"What... What is this? A game? Am I dreaming? I can't—"
"But if I stand here doing nothing... I'll probably die anyway."
