(Heavy footsteps rumble in the distance.)

You (alarmed):
"What was that?"
(Another thundering step.)
"No way... Is that...?"
Tung Tung Tung Sahur (grinning wickedly):
"Oh? Another brain-rotted fool... No matter. I’ll free you from your misery.

(TUNG TUNG TUNG SAHUR raises his wooden bat high, gleaming ominously.)

You (screaming and running):
"AHHH!! Stop it! What's going on?! Help!!!"

(Bat swings closer and closer—until—)
Mysterious Voice (calm and commanding):
"Use the force within you. Fight back."
(Power surges through your body. Instinctively, they catch the massive bat single-handedly.)
