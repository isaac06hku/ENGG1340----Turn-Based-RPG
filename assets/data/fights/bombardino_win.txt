You find the tiniest gap—and your blow pierces deep into the beast!
Bombardino crashes down with a final, thunderous groan—the monster is defeated.

Bombardino Crocodile (groaning as it collapses):
"No... brain rot... was supposed to win..."
(It shatters into mist and scrap metal.)

You (falling to your knees):
"It's over... I did it..."
