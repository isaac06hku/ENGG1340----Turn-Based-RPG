The wind breezed across the coastline, a restless sigh weaving through the salt-heavy air
The waves washed against the beach in a rhythmic pulse, their frothy edges clawing at the shore before retreating
A trail of footprints, fresh and deliberate, carving an uneven path along the shore.
It's almost like three nikes made them.

(Suddenlyâ€”)
You (spotting something):
"Footprints... fresh ones..."
(They trail ahead along the forest floor, leading toward the coast.)
