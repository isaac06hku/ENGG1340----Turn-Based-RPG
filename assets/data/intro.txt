You wake up to a strange rythm in the distance…
Sound: Tung tung tung tung tung tung tung sahur…
You (laughing breathlessly):
"Will Bombardino Crocodilo win, or…" 
(The laughter becomes strained. Breaths grow short.)
You (gasping): "I... I can't breathe... My head... it's spinning..."
(The world blurs. Fades.)
You (weakly): "What... what’s happening...?"
(Darkness swallows everything. All fades to silence once more.)
